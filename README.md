# FACTORIAL CALCULATION

Description:

This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code implements a Factorial Calculator with a dark theme.

Functionality:

User Interface:
A visually appealing interface with a dark background and subtle gradients.
A user-friendly input field for entering an integer.
A clear "Calculate" button to trigger the factorial calculation.
A dedicated area to display the calculated results.
Input Validation:
Verifies that the user input is a valid positive integer.
Displays an error message if the input is invalid.
Factorial Calculation:
Implements two methods for calculating the factorial:
Iterative Method: Utilizes a for loop to iteratively multiply numbers from 1 to the input value.
Recursive Method: Employs a recursive function to calculate the factorial by repeatedly calling itself with a reduced number.
Output:
Displays both the iterative and recursive factorial results in a clear and concise format.
Technical Implementation:

HTML: Structures the page with appropriate elements for input, button, and result display.
CSS: Defines the visual appearance of the page, including:
Dark background and colors for a visually appealing dark theme.
Styling for the container, input field, button, and result display.
JavaScript: Handles user input, performs the factorial calculations using both iterative and recursive methods, and dynamically updates the HTML to display the results.

-> Conclusion:

This code successfully demonstrates a functional and visually appealing factorial calculator. It effectively combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly and interactive web application. The use of a dark theme enhances the visual appeal and can be more comfortable for some users. This project serves as a good foundation for learning basic web development concepts and can be further enhanced with additional features like:

Error Handling: More robust error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., handling very large numbers).
User Experience: Adding features like a "Clear" button, input history, or a more interactive interface.
Performance Optimization: Exploring more efficient factorial calculation algorithms.
Accessibility: Improving accessibility for users with disabilities (e.g., screen reader compatibility).
